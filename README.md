## Getting to the personal part:

I am passionate about exploring the endless possibilities of mathematics and finding creative [solutions to complex problems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72539638/226156726-3a100b3a-c3fe-46af-822e-bf76f0ab2eda.png). For instance, on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I particularly enjoyed working on [problem #78](https://projecteuler.net/problem=78), which involved coin partitions. As part of my research on integer partition, I optimized  code by 5X implementing [Ramanujan's work on integer partition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72539638/226156980-391121e6-ce4b-492a-872b-d2b2397a6be0.png)


To say in brief I do not code but use codes for mathematics only.



I love Python and its extensive libraries have been helping me visualizing data and making calculations a lot easier. I sometimes spend my time finding direction of stocks and commodities futures attempting to decipher the previous patterns, news, global market, and global supply chain.
