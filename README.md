## MY REPOSITORIES ARE NOT PUBLIC <= FY25***


### I'm passionate for solving complex problems.

I am a polymath with [interests in a number of subjects](./images/subjects.png). To a lesser or greater extent, I have been deeply influenced by mathematicians, physicists, and economists. My pursuits largely revolve around mathematics, finance, software development, and trading. None of these areas can be fully explored without data analysis, which forms a continuous loop in my exploration. For reasons related to quant and latency, I gravitate towards low-level programming languages like C and C++. However, none of my projects are complete without a touch of Python.

I wouldn't label myself as self-taught. It's simply that my prime hobby involves sitting in front of a laptop. Despite this, I'm a highly diversified individual. I hold a strong belief in Darwinism, survival of the most adaptive and recognize the significance of public communication, ethics, morals, capitalism, democracy, economics, human psychology, spirituality, and to some extent, human anatomy.

    Python is my passion, but I also use code for mathematics. Its extensive libraries have helped me to visualize data
    and make calculations a breeze. I love spending my time trying to find the direction of stock and commodity futures
    by deciphering previous patterns, news, the global market, and the global supply chain. I'm always up for a challenge,
    and I'm always looking for new ways to use code to solve problems.



Nothing mentioned above is complete, and it will never be, I prioritize my privacy more than anything else. [learn more](https://1darshanpatil.github.io/blog/privacyFolds/crudeprivacy.html)
