## Getting to the personal part:

I am passionate about exploring the endless possibilities of mathematics and finding creative [solutions to complex problems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72539638/226156726-3a100b3a-c3fe-46af-822e-bf76f0ab2eda.png). For instance, on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), I particularly enjoyed working on [problem #78](https://projecteuler.net/problem=78), which involved coin partitions. As part of my research on integer partition, I optimized  code by 5X implementing [Ramanujan's work on integer partition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72539638/226156980-391121e6-ce4b-492a-872b-d2b2397a6be0.png)

    Python is my passion, but I also use code for mathematics. Its extensive libraries have helped me to visualize data and make calculations a breeze. I love spending my time trying to find the direction of stock      and commodity futures by deciphering previous patterns, news, the global market, and the global supply chain. I'm always up for a challenge, and I'm always looking for new ways to use code to solve problems.
